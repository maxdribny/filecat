## Installation

### From Releases

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/maxdribny/filecat/releases).

cd filecat
go build -o filecat ./cmd/filecat
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Combine all .go files in current directory
filecat -e go

# Combine all .js files and generate a directory tree
filecat -e js -t

# Count lines in all .py files without combining them
filecat -e py -c --no-combine

# Combine files and copy directly to clipboard

```

## Usage

```
filecat - Source File Combiner and Analyzer
=============================================

'filecat' is an easy to use command line tool written in Go that helps you combine multiple file sources into one, 
generate directory trees, and analyze code files.

Usage:
  filecat [flags]

Flags:
  -y, --copy           Copy output file contents to clipboard
  -c, --count          Count lines of code and display total
  -e, --ext string     File extension(s) to search for (comma-separated, without dots)
                       Examples: "go" or "java,js,py"
  -x, --exclude string Directories to exclude (comma-separated)
                       Examples: "node_modules,dist" or "test,vendor"
                       Note: .git, .idea, .vscode, node_modules, build, and dist are excluded by default
  -h, --help           help for filecat
      --no-combine     Skip combining files (useful with -c to only count lines)
  -o, --out string     Output file name
                       Example: "combined_code.txt" (default "combined_files.txt")
  -r, --root string    Root directory to start search from
                       Examples: "." (current directory) or "C:\path\to\project\src" (default ".")
  -t, --tree           Show directory tree of matching files
```

## Common Usage Patterns

1. **Find and combine all Go files in current directory:**
   ```bash
   filecat -e go
   ```

2. **Generate directory tree and count lines (without combining):**
   ```bash
   filecat -e java -t -c --no-combine
   ```

3. **Combine files with specific extension from a directory and save to custom file:**
   ```bash
   filecat -e js -r "./src" -o "javascript_code.txt"
   ```

4. **Work with multiple file extensions:**
   ```bash
   filecat -e "js,ts,jsx" -r "./web" -t
   ```

5. **Combine files and copy result to clipboard:**
   ```bash
   filecat -e py -y
   ```

## Using with AI Assistants

FileCat helps you provide rich context to AI assistants like ChatGPT and Claude:

1. Run FileCat to generate a combined file:
   ```bash
   filecat -e go,yaml -t -o my_project.txt
   ```

2. Upload `my_project.txt` to your AI chat or copy/paste its contents
   ```bash
   filecat -e go,yaml -t -y  # Copies directly to clipboard
   ```

3. Ask questions about your code with complete context

## Why FileCat?

- **Save Time**: No more manually copying multiple files
- **Preserve Context**: Directory structure plus file contents gives AI better understanding
- **Focus**: Only include the files that matter for your question
- **Organize**: Well-formatted output makes it easier for both you and the AI
